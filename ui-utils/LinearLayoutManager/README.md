# LinearLayoutManager

This is a copy of the `LinearLayoutManager` class and its helpers from [AndroidX RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/recyclerview) 1.2.1.

It was modified to change the anchor behavior when new items are added to the top of the list. See [#6378](https://github.com/thunderbird/thunderbird-android/pull/6379).

Changes to this class should be limited to the functional changes we need. The aim is to make it easier to rebase on AndroidX's version of `LinearLayoutManager`.
This meansâ€¦

- we're not converting this class to Kotlin unless AndroidX changes their version,
- and we're ignoring warnings generated by unmodified code.
