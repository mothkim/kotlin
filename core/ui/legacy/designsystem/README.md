## Core - UI - Legacy - Design System

This is the design system dedicated to the legacy UI implementation based on XML-based layouts for Android.

> [!WARNING]
> It's not suggested to use this design system for new features!
>
> This is only maintained for the purpose of supporting the existing implementation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the Composable UI along our [theme 2](../compose/theme2) and [design system](../compose/designsystem) design system instead.
