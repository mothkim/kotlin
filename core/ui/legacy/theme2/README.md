## Core - UI - Legacy - Theme 2

Legacy Theme 2 represents a Material 3 adaptation of the legacy application theme. It follows the design principles of Material 3, while ensuring compatibility with the existing implementation.

It is available in two variants:

- [K9Mail](./k9mail) - The theme for the K-9 Mail app.
- [Thunderbird](./thunderbird) - The theme for the Thunderbird app.

It's not suggested to use the contained modules for new features. Use the Composable UI along our [theme 2](../../compose/theme2) and [design system](../../compose/designsystem) instead.

This is only maintained for the purpose of supporting the existing implementation.
